reapply correction to He II 2s,p energies
the energies of these levels must be "fixed" if 
we update to NIST values

energies / He II 2s,p edges overlap with H I causing
OTS logic guard trip.

this had been applied at some point to master:
# 20 08 17 adjust this edge away from H I edge
# 2 -1 -1 -1 329182.3
 2 -1 -1 -1 329181.7029
